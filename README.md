# ai-for-the-arts

<p>The purpose of this repository is to document my use of Python, and to showcase my learning experience. Using Microsoft Copilot as an assistant, I am able to understand how code is used in 'beginner' language'. My goal for the end of this course is to have a basic understanding of Python, that may help me in any future learning I want to take on.</p>
