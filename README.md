<h1> AI For The Arts and Humanities Portfolio</h1>

<p>
We are taking a shortcut, to focus on how to read existing code instead of how to write code,
and, to develop skills on how to present code to a broader arts and humanities
audience to share your interpretation of the model instead of how to develop the
models. This will help us reflect more deeply on the more human-centric social and
cultural implications of AI.
